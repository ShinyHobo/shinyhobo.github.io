# Scheduled Deliverables #  
#### as of 2023-08-23 ####  
## There are currently 78 scheduled deliverables being worked on by 55 teams ##  
### 4 deliverables are scheduled to begin work by 3 team(s) within two weeks ###  
---  
This report lists the actively assigned deliverables and the associated teams, along with the number
of developers assigned to each time period. Deliverable time allocations are often staggered over
their total lifespan and have multiple devs in the same department working in parallel, but their
allocations are obviously not going to be equal.  
  
The load calculation is an approximation based on the sum of the part-time and full-time tasks
(averaged at 80 hours to complete a piece) divided by the team capacity (with a focus factor of 60%)
over the given time period. Without exact hourly estimates for each task, a more accurate assessment
doesn't seem likely, so interpret the load as a given dev group's general utilization on a
deliverable.
  
---  
There are approximately 376 devs (out of ~512, or 73%) with 775 assignments scheduled to work on 78
observable deliverables. Of those deliverables, 31% are for SQ42 exclusively, with ~308 devs (60%)
scheduled for approximately 7296 man-days. 23% of deliverables are shared between both projects.
